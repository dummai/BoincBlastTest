# Grid implementation on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) by Berkley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing

## Objectives of this project
1. This project aims to setup BOINC system that distributes tasks of BLAST (e.g. query sequences and databases ) to each computer client node within an organization or institute. 
2. This project aims to use a "grid computing" mode of BOINC. For, a "volunteer computing" mode please refer to references below.

## Prerequisite
1. Several personal computers to serve as clients with:
    1.1 Microsoft Windows as the main operating system (32-bit or 64-bit is OK)
    1.2 Installed with BOINC manager (http://boinc.berkeley.edu/wiki/BOINC_Manager)
    1.3 Full authorization to access each computer during performing BLAST (e.g. during off-hours)
2.
